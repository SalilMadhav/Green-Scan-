<h1>🌾 Smart Rover Agriculture Dashboard</h1>
A powerful, real-time web-based platform that connects to your smart rover to monitor agricultural data and recommend the best crops based on live soil conditions.

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<h3>🔐 Login System: Secure access for users and admins.</h3>

<h3>📊 Live Dashboard: Tracks real-time rover activity, including:</h3>

<li>Soil pH levels</li>

<li>Moisture levels</li>

<li>Activity timestamps</li>

<li>Movement or area covered</li>

<h3>🌱 Crop Recommendation Engine:</h3>

Automatically suggests suitable crops based on soil health metrics.

Works with both acidic and neutral/alkaline plant types.

<h3>🛠️ Admin Panel:</h3>

Manage users

View rover logs and crop suggestions

Update system settings

<h3>🌗 Dark Mode:</h3> Seamless toggle between Light and Dark themes for better UX.

<h2>🧠 How It Works</h2>
The rover collects real-time data (pH, moisture, etc.) and transmits it to the server.

The dashboard displays incoming data live.

Based on soil conditions, the system computes a fertility score and recommends crops.

Users and admins can monitor everything via a beautiful web interface.

<h2>🌾 Crop Recommendation Logic</h2>
Based on:

Soil pH

Acidic (4.5 - 5.5): Suitable for blueberries, azaleas, etc.

Neutral (6.0 - 7.0): Suitable for tomatoes, beans, wheat, etc.

Moisture

Ideal range: 20–60%

Alerts user if soil is too dry or overly wet
